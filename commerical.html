<h1 padding='100px'>Mukt jewellers</h1>
<p align="center" id='p1' >Mukt Jewellers approached DGA with a requirement of creating gigantic jewellery mall. They had purchased 30 shops at a retail mall and wanted to converted into one exclusive jewellery showroom. The design of the store should broaden their client base and ensure locality to their older clients. The showroom is spread across 35,000 sq ft. with 3 floors and a basement with parking.</p>

<h1 padding='100px'>Concept I GYM</h1>
<p align="center" id='p2'>Our shoulders were laid upon with the responsibility of taking up the interiors of this project. We had to be very patient and considerate towards the structural design and beam grid. Because it is a multi-storey building and we have clubbed many adjoining shops, taking the large number of columns in consideration was a bigger challenge. Floor height being the main constraint, we had to deal utilising our expertise. Unlike other conventional gyms, our inference was to deliver something which has never been delivered into the health and fitness segment. Combining art with rigorous discipline was something that we wanted to achieve. To a large extent, we have been successful in achieving our ideologies.</p>
